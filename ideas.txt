Random Unique Ideas:

-Have two computers (a dumb one and a smart one) play against each other

-Try to play two games at the same time (as this is very modular).

-a mode where the players asynchronously attack each other, but they have a limited 'juice' bar so they can't just spam top to bottom (but it's still enough for you to want to rush).
-p1 plays with mouse, p2 plays with keyboard
